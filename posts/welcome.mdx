## Welcome, visitor

This is my little corner of the internet where I share my projects and thoughts. If you're reading this right after launch, you might find it a bit empty - more content is on the way!

## The tech stack

I built this website with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), styled it with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and added some polish with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. Props to [Red Pangilinan's website](https://rdev.pro/) for the inspiration - definitely check it out.

Want to peek under the hood? The source code will be up on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcodsn/marcodsn.me) soon. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own site.

## Content components

Here's a quick tour of the initial components I'll use for writing posts:

### Images

Need visuals? Use either the Image component or standard markdown:

```jsx
import Image from 'components';

// With custom dimensions
<Image src="/images/nextjs.png" alt="Next.js logo" width={200} height={200} />

// Or simple markdown style
![Next.js logo](/images/nextjs.png)
```

### Code blocks

For sharing code snippets (with syntax highlighting and a copy button):

```jsx
const greeting = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello world</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### InlineCode

For those times when you need to highlight <InlineCode>code</InlineCode> or <InlineCode>technical terms</InlineCode> in text:

```jsx
<InlineCode>const hello = 'world';</InlineCode>
```

## What's next

I'll be posting about projects I'm working on, interesting problems I've solved, and whatever catches my attention in tech (or not). Whether you're here to learn something new or just browsing around, I hope you find something interesting. Thanks for stopping by!
